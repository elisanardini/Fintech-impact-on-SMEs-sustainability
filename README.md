## Fintech impact on sustainability of the Small and Medium Enterprises in the Triveneto area

This repository contains the code needed to run the experiments of my thesis work "Fintech impact on sustainability of the Small and Medium Enterprises in the Triveneto area". 

The primary challenge for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) today is to drive growth while maintaining ecological sustainability and promoting social responsibility. SMEs often face financial constraints that hinder their sustainability initiatives, primarily due to information gaps between them and banks, leading to credit denials. Fintech solutions help bridge this financing gap by enhancing information processing and collection, facilitating smoother financial transactions, and improving oversight of operations and investments to support sustainable management.
This study integrates Ecological Modernization Theory (EMT), the Practice-Based View (PBV), and Dynamic Capabilities Theory (DCT) to examine the impact of Fintech adoption on organizational performance and Circular Economy practices. Data was collected via a structured questionnaire from SMEs in the Triveneto region of Northeast Italy across various sectors. We used multivariate regression to evaluate the hypotheses, finding that Fintech adoption improves competitiveness, performance, and sustainability. These insights help fill a gap in the literature on Italian SMEs and offer valuable guidance for enterprises and stakeholders to leverage technological advancements and human capital to mitigate environmental impacts.
